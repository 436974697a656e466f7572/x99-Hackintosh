This guide is a work in progress and is updated when I get the time. 

X99 is a troublesome platform when it comes to Hackintoshing.

The hardware used for this build is as follows:
Intel I7-5820k (Haswell-E)
Gigabyte OC 5700XT 8Gb Graphics Card
MSI X99A SLi Plus Motherboard
32GB DDR4 2866mhz (Corsair Vengeance)
Fenvi T919 Wireless/Bluetooth PCIE card (native support, no kexts needed)
480GB Corsair SSD

Lets start with the bios settings, the only things I have changed are:

Settings > Advanced > PCI Subsystem Settings
Enabled Above 4G Decoding (this takes the place of npci= boot flags).

Settings > Advanced > Power Management Setup
Windows 8/8.1 Configuration - Enabled
Fast/Secure Boot - Disabled.

Overclocking > CPU Features.
Execute Disable Bit - Enabled.
Intel C-State - Enabled.
C1E Support - Enabled.
EIST - Disabled.
CFG Lock - Disabled.

This combination of settings allowed Power Management to work correctly for me.
